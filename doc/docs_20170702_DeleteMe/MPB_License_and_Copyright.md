*Omnis enim res, quae dando non deficit, dum habetur et non datur, nondum habetur, quomodo habenda est.*

"For if a thing is not diminished by being shared with others, it is not rightly owned if it is only owned and not shared."


(Saint Augustine, [*De Doctrina Christiana*](http://www.ccel.org/a/augustine/doctrine/doctrine.html), *c.* 396 AD.)
