Downloading MPB
---------------

MIT Photonic-Bands 1.5 is the current version of MPB (see the [MPB release notes](/MPB_release_notes "wikilink") to find out what's changed). You can download it from:

-   <http://ab-initio.mit.edu/mpb/mpb-1.5.tar.gz> (requires [libctl](/libctl "wikilink") version 3.2.1 or later).

Be sure to look at the [installation section](/MPB_Installation "wikilink") of the manual. MPB should work on most any Unix-like operating system, but you may need to install a number of other packages first (*e.g.*, BLAS, LAPACK, HDF5, Guile), as described in the installation instructions. Also, see below for additional notes for specific systems.

MIT Photonic Bands is free software under the GNU General Public License; see the [MPB License and Copyright](/MPB_License_and_Copyright "wikilink") section of the documentation for additional information. Note especially that it comes **as-is** with **no warranty** (see the license for more details)

### Precompiled MPB packages

Installation of MPB can be much [easier on Debian GNU/Linux](/MPB_on_Debian "wikilink"), where all of the prerequisites can be fetched automatically. If you haven't settled on a Linux distribution yet, I highly recommend [Debian](http://www.debian.org/).

MacOS X users can get MPB via a Debian-like interface by using [Fink](http://fink.sourceforge.net/), which now includes an [MPB package](http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/mpb) thanks to Aurelien Chanudet.

### Installation on Windows

It is possible to install MPB under Windows by using [Cygwin](/w:Cygwin "wikilink"), a free Unix-compatibility environment for Windows.

One MPB user, Robert Hovden, wrote a brief [guide on installing MPB under Cygwin](http://robert.hovden.googlepages.com/MPBonCygwin.pdf) that should be helpful.

### MPB on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

The latest, pre-installed versions of MPB and Meep running on Ubuntu can also be accessed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) as a free [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01KHWH0AS). To access this AMI, follow these [instructions](http://www.simpetuscloud.com/launchsims.html).
