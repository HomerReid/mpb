MIT Photonic-Bands
==================

Welcome to the manual for the [MIT Photonic-Bands](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/mpb/) (MPB) package, a program for computing band structures (dispersion relations) of optical systems. MPB was developed by [Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj) of MIT Applied Mathematics, in collaboration with the Joannopoulos [Ab Initio Physics Group](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/) in the Condensed Matter Theory division of the [MIT Physics Department](http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/org/p/physics/www/physics.html).

Overview
--------

This documentation is divided into the following sections:

-   [MPB Introduction](/MPB_Introduction "wikilink"): The introductory section describes the motivation, history, and high-level structure of this package.
-   [MPB Installation](/MPB_Installation "wikilink"): How to install and compile MPB, including descriptions of and links to software you must first download and install from other sources.
-   [MPB User Tutorial](/MPB_User_Tutorial "wikilink"): In this section, we introduce the use of MPB to compute a photonic band structure. A simple tutorial illustrates how the basic features are used to solve for the modes of example structures.
-   [MPB Data Analysis Tutorial](/MPB_Data_Analysis_Tutorial "wikilink"): Here, we walk through how you might analyze and visualize the results from a couple of typical MPB calculations. Includes some pretty pictures for those who don't like to read.
-   [MPB User Reference](/MPB_User_Reference "wikilink"): A compact listing of the various functions and features provided by the user interface.
-   [MPB Developer Information](/MPB_Developer_Information "wikilink"): In this section, we outline some of the internal structure and algorithms used in Photonic-Bands, as an aid to outside developers wishing to add new features and bugs.
-   [MPB Acknowledgements](/MPB_Acknowledgements "wikilink"): A project of this size could never be completed without the support of many others, to whom we are very grateful.
-   [MPB License and Copyright](/MPB_License_and_Copyright "wikilink"): MIT Photonic Bands is free software under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (GNU [GPL](/w:GPL "wikilink")). Also see this section for referencing information.
